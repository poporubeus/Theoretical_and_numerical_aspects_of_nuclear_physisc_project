# Theoretical and numerical aspects of nuclear physisc project
Implementation of Bateman equation using Runge-Kutta method and matrix exponential method.

In this project we solve the Bateman's equations for a decay process that involves Iodine-135 and Xenon-135 numerically. In particular, Iodine-135 decays into Xenon-135 and the main process we see is a poison growing. 
The poisoning function represents how much Xenon-135 grows by  Iodine-135 decay. If the thermal neutron flux $\phi$ is modified we can observe many curves one inside the other.

# Numerical methods
The method chosen for this code are fourth-order Runge-Kutta and the matrix exponential method.
